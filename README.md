# Project Bert - The Robot Car Project.

## Brief

Project Bert is a robot research and development project to create an Internet of Things (IoT) controlled “robot” car.

The aim is to build two prototypes to begin with, to entertain my nephews. I’m hoping that this will not only keep them entertained, but inspire them to explore science and engineering.

## Objective

The goal is use this as a base line operation to help fund further research and development into creating a more accessible entry level robotics kit.

The plan is to put together a kit that people could buy and assemble themselves. The kit will provide everything they need to get started along with a much needed user manual and an online community, a forum owned and operated by the project. Additional supporting material, such as a book which can be purchased by those wanting more in depth guidance.

The long term goal is to be to be able to provide, in kit form or pre-built, an IoT robot that you can purchase for under £30 and can fit in your pocket.

## Analysis

The prototypes will be based on the existing “Smart Robot Cars” that are available for import.

The prototypes need to be easily accessible, using off the shelf parts where possible so that it is easy to replicate.

### Chassis

The chassis will need to be appealing to the audience. Something that sticks in your mind, such as the Johnny Five style chassis.

An alternative chassis is the Zumo chassis:

### Controller

The NodeMCU ESP8266 platform was chosen over Raspberry Pi or Arduino options for a number of reasons, mainly that it has what I need at less cost. Compared to the Raspberry Pi, it has a much smaller profile. Ultimately, it does everything I need and will ultimately be more cost effective while still having a highly extendable (or “hackable”) platform at the heart of it.

#### Platform

As the controller is ESP8266 based we have some options for our platform.

There's a number of ways to program the ESP8266 chip.

#### Blynk

"While there are other platforms for controlling hardware over the internet (Particle, ThingSpeak, Temboo, IFTTT), Blynk is one of the most user-friendly I’ve seen yet, and it’s also free and open-source under an MIT license"

- [NodeMCU with Blynk and Firebase](https://www.slideshare.net/e2m/nodemcu-with-blynk-and-firebase)

#### Lua

Lua is a lightweight programming language, ideal for embedded systems, but as it requires compiling it, which means a complex toolchain.

#### Arduino

We're going to use the Arduino platform which allows us to leverage the Arduino IDE and extensive libraries.
